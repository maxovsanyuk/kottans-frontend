### New for me from passed materials:

* ls -alt (lists all contents, including hidden files and directories, in long format, ordered by the date and time they were last modified.
)
* m*.txt (selects all files in the working directory starting with "m" and ending with ".txt")

* Redirection and redirection commands were absolutely new materials for me.

* Thanks to 'alias' command I'm able to create own keyboard shortcuts for a quicker work with iTerm.
Very useful and convenient tool.
